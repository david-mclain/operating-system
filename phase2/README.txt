- The output produces the correct results with the correct join status for the correct child, it is just a difference in implementation of unblocking processes that causes there to be a one line difference in the expected output and my output

TESTCASE test13
- The output only differs by a few microseconds in each instance, and is near 100k in the first status, and roughly 100k more in the second status

TESTCASE test30
